A project created by myself and Emily Tran in Discrete Structures and Algorithms. 
It was made to sort through a large dataset containing various different music tracks and artists using a Splay Tree data structure, as connected to the Million Song Dataset. 
Instructions for use are detailed in the compiler upon activation.
